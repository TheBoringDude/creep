I am a really weird person. My personality is so different that sometimes, I show a very different reaction on a such cases.

## I prefer sad endings and ballad songs

Ballad songs fit with sad endings and it becomes emotional. I am not sure but I don't think I am emotional. It's just that the song kinds of touches the inside of me.

Anyone would prefer a happy ending on movies, but for me, the story gets boring. If the ending is the opposite, it still gets intense and there is still the thrill in watching it.

## Inspirational stories

I'm not a fan of any inspirational story. Either from movies or books, I kind of don't like it.

In movies or films, the power of friendship overpowers skill and power, but how? It's nonsense, in reality, friends only care about you if they experience near death or they are not well. If they are ok, they don't care that much about you at all.

For personal stories, it has no sense, similarly. It may give hope to others but it's just that you also need to do what that person does in his story. We all have different lives so we also have different tastes and experiences. Such things wouldn't be applicable to everyone.

## ...

Maybe there are other people who have similar tastes with me and I don't know. It may not only me but there may be others as well. I hope that by writing this, I won't change my decision in life.
