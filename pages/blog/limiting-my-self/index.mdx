I too, am not perfect and is a person with many sins. 

## Showing off
I have this side or mode of me where I show off things to anyone. I always keep myself calm on any matter but sometimes, I become too stressed that I want to make the others know their place. When someone thinks they are the best at such thing, I keep calm but when they go overboard I feel like I want to make this person embarassed.

## School
In a school environment, when someone asks me if I'm done with my homeworks, I always say no (but sometimes, I really forgot to do my homework, hahahhaha). I am not being selfish, it's just that I do not want to get tired explaining to them how I got the answer. Also, I do not want the other person to think of me as a perfect person who does his activities on time.

During my early to mid-school years, when electing officers, I kind of hint them that I want this kind of position (auditor, hahahhaha). Since I am good in math, I feel like I should be the one in this position. But then when I was in Grade 9, I suddenly felt tired and I kind of do not want anyone to notice me anymore. I want to give the position of officers to others. Same with the other reasons, I do not want to be tired. It's funny but it is mainly the reason why I am becoming inactive.

## Speaking to others
When I speak, I always think first on I will talk about before speaking or chatting on a messenger platform. I do not want the other side to feel offended on what I'm about to say. It is because, if I talk carelessly, I might spill out some of my secrets and I might show off some things to them. I want the other side to atleast feel at ease and treat me a comfortable, a common and a normal friend.

## I do not want to be tired and stressed
This is the main reason why I limit myself. I just want things to go as they are and I do not want to use my brain in thinking for a reply or an answer. I know that going overboard would complicate things so I just keep other things related to the topic to myself.

I just go overboard if I'm triggered by something. xD
