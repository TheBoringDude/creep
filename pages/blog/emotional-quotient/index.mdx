I am an emotional person. I get carried away too much by my emotions.

## Being emotional

Being emotional, meaning in real life, not when watching movies or being dramatic over such matters. In a situation where one decide on what to do, emotions gets mixed in so, thinking of a solution becomes hard and difficult. I have this within me. I think too much, it's the main reason.

It's good thinking about the possibilities, and I know that myself, but it is within me and is kind of hard to fight and control it. When doing such simple tasks, I do not know what to do which would just waste a lot of time.

With group activities, I always worry on the possible outcomes before, during and after. This is one of the reasons why I prefer working alone rather than a group. With me, just myself, I don't have to worry about others. Also, I get worried if I should be caring (include, even though they haven't done anything) to my other classmates or not.

It's kind of a good personality of mine, but also, it lowers and lessens my morale. Since I get carried away too much by my emotions, I usually get nervous without even doing anything yet.

## Simplicity

If I get carried away too much, it wastes a lot of time. Therefore, I sometimes tend to be as simple as possible and forget everything. With this, I can manage to control my emotions. It is helpful but is kind of careless. I become careless which results to negative results.

I understand it because I am too, is not perfect. But it's counterpart damage is just kind of greater.

## What I want

How does it feel not feeling any kind of emotion at all. Well, being emotional is important in order to become humane in doing actions though. I want to try being someone that can manage his emotions.

Like for example, when someone begs for help, it is normal to help him / her / them. I want to have the ability to foresee perspectives and solutions, then I can make my decision. I want to have a poker face which no one can read what I am thinking.

In short, I want to become a cold person outside, but inside, I can become a good and a friendly person. It would be really incredible, I think so.

Maybe in the future, I might be able to control my emotionaliy, hope so.
