## Watching

I like watching anything as long as I have taken a like to it, series, movies, anime or kdrama, anything. Sometimes, I specially prefer watching Korean variety shows to start of the week or end the day in order to relieve my stress. It makes me laugh and enjoy the show. Also, I prefer watching comedy movies because I can just relax and there is no need to think like for other themes such as thriller or crime.

## Memes

I love memes also. As long as I find it funny, I would laugh, it's just that I make it in a silent way. I kind of prefer the memes being posted on Facebook rather than on other sites but I also browse others such as 9Gag and Gif-Vif. Who would not laugh after seeing a meme and it's message.

## Chatting with Friends

Friends are always the best. Chatting with them, personal or through a messenger app is nice and cool. You guys share and discuss again another topic for entertainment. It's nice to have some friends.

## Coding / Programming

I would really feel happy and delighted if my code or program runs successfully without errors and bugs. Which programmer would not be happy about it? After getting a job done / coding, you kind of have this feeling that all of the hard feelings and stress from yourself gets removed and replinished.

## Helping others

Helping others would make the heart feel at ease and would reveal a smile on the face. It shows that you care and the other side feel also at ease with your help and says the word, 'Thank you'. It makes the heart feel loved.

## Others

I just want to live a simple life and enjoy it. I do not like having something hindering it.

I am not a cold person, it's just that I have a very shy personality.
