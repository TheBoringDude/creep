## An Unlucky Fate

Everytime I need to do something important, there's always something that hinders it. What an unlucky fate that I have. The events acould be so frustrating or stressful that I can't do what I must do which could pose a problem or a risk.

For example, if I have to pass an activity or there is an school activity that is needed and is only available during or in night time, what usually happens is that, the current suddenly goes off which leaves me nothing to do, just waiting for it to come back. In other cases, I need to do other stuff in the house which also results in me can't possibly do it.

## My Life

I have already planned on what to do but it is so sudden that my plans fail unexpectedly and miserably. No matter what I do, I am very unlucky and it seems that I cannot escape it. What a life I have.
