This is me, even though I am conspired to be a hard working person, I also am not perfect. I also have limitations and it comes depending on the situation or time.

## Becoming Lazy

If I become lazy, it means that I have reached my limitations. It's like I want to rest, relax and just watch movies and anime. And when I reach it, I do not oo anything, I stop in doing some work or other activities and hobbies I am fond of.

I usually experience this after making coding projects. As I continue, I become lazy until I stop and discontinue the project I was working on. It's like my mind stops functioning and it wants to sleep. Even I also want to sleep, hahahhaha.

## Overcoming it

I still don't know how to overcome. It's like it has been fixed to me and I should follow or do it. I still try other methods like overexceeding it and trying to limit myself. After feeling tired, I try to relax and watch.

It's a nice thing though for my mind and my body to relax, but I would like to exceed over my limits, just once. I want to experience it sometime. How would it feel like?
