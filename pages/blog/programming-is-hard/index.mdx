I self-study about programming and practicing by trying out anything, from programming languages to the frameworks. It is really a great hobby of mine as mentioned also in my other blogs. But, it is really hard and difficult.

## It is hard.

Programming is also hard and complicated for me. Even for a simple problem, there is this childish kind of attitude I have that I want the solution not the methods like that. It is fun developing simple and mini-projects and I can still handle up to that point.

Sometimes, I challenge myself to do other things that are more difficult. As things go on smoothly from the start, it becomes difficult and more errors and bugs appear. When solving bugs and errors in my code, it is the most stressful but is fun once again if you fixed it.

Also, I come to the point that after searching and searching, I want to give up. It is stressful that I want to just watch and sleep and continue again tomorrow. But what can I do, I want to learn, hahahhaa.

## Reading

I believe that reading is still that best way to learn things. Like for example, if you don't read the docs, you wouldn't know how things work. Video tutorials might help but it still lacks some of the basics.

## Keeping things simple

I finally realized this saying or phrase in the programming world where you should just keep things simple rather than complicate it. I'm so done that wahhhh, I should have kept things simple as they are. Also I agree with this phrase, '_the more you know, the more things get complicated_'.
