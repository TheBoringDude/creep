I, too, love coffees but just on the drinking part (hahhaha).

## Drinking coffee

It's not that I am addicted to it but as long as there is coffee powder / granules or prepared one, I always find it. I prefer having coffee after meal time or during break. If there is nothing, then none. Why would I find something which is not existing.

Depending on what's available, I like the Baraco and 3-in-one packs. Also, it depends on my mood if what kind of coffee should I drink. I prefer my drink to have less sugar as possible. With black coffee, I prefer having not more than a teaspoon of sugar. For the 3-in-one's, it depends.

## Energizer?

Coffee, for me, kinds of boosts my mood and energy to function and work well. It is somewhat similar to soft drinks. The taste of it kinds of boosts the mind to continue calculating and the body to function.

The drawback is just that, if I drink too much in a day, I suddenly become tired and sleepy suddenly. Maybe, my body can't consume too much caffeign and so, I become exhausted and I want to stop and go to sleep.

## Still

While other can't fall asleep after drinking coffee, for me, it's the other side around. Maybe I became immune from it (hahahha). But sometimes, depending on the situation, I can't fall asleep too.

Drinking too much coffee they say is bad. But, who cares, it has become a hobby of mine and a part of me. I just drink nothing else.

Hope someone will sponsor to give some coffee in the future. Hahahhaha
