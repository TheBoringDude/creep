I am a very unlucky person and never have I won in a game of chance. There are only times when I desperately need it or the outcome I want then, I become lucky but it's only at that point.

## Unlucky fate

My fate can't be all good and nice. It needs to have stressful and somewhat negative ones. It's like a magnet with polar opposites and I think it is a rule in my fate. If I have a positive one, then I would have a negative one later.

It's crazy and once I become lucky there's no more. In a game of chance, it's a one of thousand possible choices that I will be picked and its like I need to taste it and no more.

Also, for example, if I solved a problem, I am for sure thinking of it deeply, and then, I would be out of my focus. I would do something unexpected because my brain is just focused on something. I do the absurd and funny action / reaction possible.

Like for this one, I don't even know what I am talking about and yet I still uploaded it. (hahahaha)

## Luck or skill?

They say that it depends on the skill, yeah of course, but for me it is about luck. Even if I have the skill, if I fuck it up, it's over but sometimes, even if I fuck it up, the outcome is the best and the better than what is should be. That's why I am very dependent to luck.

It's funny but that's how I am inside. It is not the skill that controls the finale, but is my luck. If I become successful or not could also depend on my luck.

I don't know what to do. This is my life and I am just going to where the wind blows. (xD)
