I'm a very shy person and I admit it that I have trouble talking to other people for the first time.

## A Silent Person
They say that a silent person is very dangerous because you don't know what he / she is thinking. Well, I agree to it, since being silent, you also have a poker face. A face that can kill anytime.

Depending on my mood, I can become either happy or angry on the inside. But, I have no other malicious intentions if I am not talking. Rather, I prefer to speak if I am in a comfortable environment. Like for example, with friends or people that I trust and I know.

## Why
I prefer being silent rather than nosy person. I just do not want to get into trouble once I talk about something which should not be. Also, I do not want others knowing what things I prefer and like. I want them to see me as just a normal person.

I do not want to hurt others. For being silent, I have heard many secrets from friends and any people that I just heard. I do not want to start gossiping about things and other people's life and doings. They are person too and I kind of feel them.

I do not want to show off. I do not like bragging at all. If someone found out about what I like and prefer, then I would only start to talk.

## Reason
Since the days, I have experienced random things, events and happenings in my life. I tried to learn how things works and people's actions. From then, I preffered to be silent and just become an observer. A person who just observes hi environment then decides on what actions to take.

I decided to just live a simple life where I can just live comfortably. Also, I do not like being under pressure or any other circumstances where I become the center of attraction.

There is nothing else in my life. My life is kinda boring but I love it. Just that, it isn't that complete yet.
