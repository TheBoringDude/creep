Normally, anyone needs light or current in order to work and do some things at night. Who would not even want it. It is a very important factor for anyone who has technology or gadgets, including me ofcourse. I am heavily affected once their is a sudden brown out or no current.

## I become bored

When there are no light, especially at daytime, I become bored. I do not know what to do. At night, I would just sleep and wait for it to return but during day time, if there is nothing to do, my mind becomes blank. All of the plans I plan on doing just suddenly vanishes through the air and yeah.

My mind stops functioning on thinking what to do next when there's no current. Also, random situations and thoughts become suddenly added and included which would make it clouded. I do not know how to fix and overcome it yet though.

Having no current, in the same way, loses some of my power, morale and confidence. Because of random thoughts being a hindrance, I can't function well. It may not be shown physically on the outside but my mind is struggling.

It's funny but this usually happens when I am at home. It would be different when there are friends around though, as there could be many fun things to do.
