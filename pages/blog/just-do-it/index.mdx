## What is the thing or the one that makes you inspire to do things?
The hardest when doing a project is the start. Like, how do you start one and what tools should you use? Well not only in making a programming project but almost in anything we want to do, the start is always the hardest.

What inspires me or pushes me to make or start a new project are almost everything and anything that I stumble upon. For example, when I read an article about the uses of Bots, my mind kinds of like it to start coding one. When there some topics in school which would require some solving, I would make a solver for it. It's kind of crazy but it is how I tend to work. Anything that could be useful to me, I would want to program and code it.

## Just do it, worry later...
I kind of believe on this qoute, "Just do it and worry later". It is just true and a nice practice to follow. When I am not sure on doing something, I then just do what solution I can thing or find of then do it. Later on, I would realize my mistakes and other solutions possible while I try to analyze my output. When doing school activities, it kinds of help me do everything as fast as possible which would make me have no problem in the future. 

Even if I have a mistake in the output I made, at least I passed it in time and I would not care anymore after realizing the mistake but rather, I would then know in the future what should I do. It would serve as a learning curve and experience for me for upcoming activities. 

It is kind of crazy but, I think I get something from it beneficial which would be accomplishing tasks in the right time.

As a result, I kind of have more time having fun with myself, playing, watching and doing some random stuff. I have time to be with myself and relax sometimes and become stress free after.
