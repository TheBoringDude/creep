It's not bad being a lazy person. It's just that it strikes us if we went on too much work and we just want to do nothing absolutely.

## A time to energize
If I become lazy, it means that I want to re-energize myself because I am stressed and tired. I wanted to rest and do anything I want, being free from work, studies or anything not related to relaxing.

What would I do then? I watch movies, series, anything; read articles, news, mangas, manhwas; listen to musics; watch youtube videos. Sometimes, I would browse the coding stuff I made.

For the past days that I haven't posted any content in here, I was busy with personal, school-related and work stuff in the house. I didn't have the time to post a new blog thingy but I'll try to continue in updating this site.
