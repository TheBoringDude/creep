What does it take to be a good person? Even I, me, myself is having a hard time trying to figure out which and what is best. As what they say, it's easy to say but hard to do, and also, understand.

## A dream

I'm a good person too and I myself have strived hard to achieve it during my youngster or child days. I wanted to be someone where people consider as a very good person and a model.

But then, as I grow up I kind of realize that I shouldn't be doing it. I feel like I have been wasting my time on something which is very impossible to achieve. I think I can't achieve it.

## Disappointed

As days goes on, I experience various new and hidden things in life. I always become disappointed with the results. It's normal but somewhat is different on what I expected what it would be.

With what is happening around the world, I can't seem to understand a bit. Religion siding on different parties, people wants to achieve fame on social media, there's too much drama and hate towards each other, betrayals and so on.

## Good and evil

Then, I thought to myself. What would happen if I become a good person, nothing. People will just use me for their own needs and then forget me once they have achieved their goal.

I think that the existence of evil is to balance the extremities of the good. Being good everyday doesn't always result to similar results. In this imperfect world, the evil is the one which balances the over-the-top good qualities of a person. It is for him to realize some important things which should be taken with care and seriously.

I don't know myself anymore. I am in a dilemna which I can't choose between the two. Even I do not know if what I am saying is okay or not. What to do? I am blank.
