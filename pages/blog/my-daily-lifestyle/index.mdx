## How do I live?
I'm just also a common and normal person who just goes by where the wind blows. I eat, work, play, sleep, wash and take a rest. When there is needed or something to be done, I prepare and help in the work. When my family needs my help, I go in order to buy or waste some time and then comes the night. In night, I usually open my computer and work on anything that I want to.

I'm a nerd so I love playing anything on my computer, from coding / programming, surfing the internet, watching movies and playing some games. I am very silent even when I am in my house and I don't care on anything as long as someone asks for me or there is an emergency. 

## Eating
I am a picky eater when it comes to vegetables. I kind of do not like gingers and some other spices to be added. It is just my taste though. Also, I do not like sweets at all. I only like specific brands but when it comes to junk foods, I love them and prefer them over chocolates.

## Hobby
As said above, I love using my computer. I'm addicted and it's like my life would not be complete when I will not use it in a day. When using my computer, depending on my mood, I would either play or learn how to program / code or sometimes I try other stuff like editing.

## Using the internet
I need internet in my life. Not for using ang social media apps like facebook, or messenger but as a way for me to read some news and articles on the internet. In addition to my hobby, I need it in order to download the tools I need and learn and gain knowledge about coding / programming. I only rely on a slow internet connection so my life is not complete yet, but a fast one would do. (Hahhahaha :D)

When there is no current, my alternative would be playing on my tablet with some offline games and complete some challenges on the games. It is fun and enjoyable too but then I prioritize playing in my computer. 

## Daily Routine
I would wake up in the morning and try to some light tasks like wash my clothes, or drink a coffee. I love drinking coffee after meal times and it serves as my booster to do some work after. At night, even if I drink coffee, I still tend to sleep, not like the others wherein they can't sleep after drinking coffee.

I like living my life simple and I would love it to be in the future too. Since I am still studying my routine my get changed anytime but yeah, this is the common things I do everyday.
