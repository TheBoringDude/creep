For gamers, or computer nerds, night time is the best because of the temperature with the black backgrounds and no distractions. I do not know for some, but this is me. I kind of become alive at night but not all the time.

## Staying up at night

Well, there's no specific reason why I like to sleep late. But, commonly, I tend to become sleepy at 11PM. But sometimes, if I need to check or do something, I can go up to 5AM or even not sleep at all.

It's not good for the health, but what can I do? It has been my lifestyle and my doing. I don't what may happen if I change it though.

## What I do

At night, most of the activities that I do is watch, play, or do anything with my computer. There's nothing else, just using my computer. It's like a time for entertainment in order to relax.

In regards to school activities, if I have a homework which is difficult to do, I tend to make it at night. In that time, I can think more as there is lesser noise and distraction and any hindrances.

I'm just a simple man too. :)
