I really love Facebook because of it's capability to interact with other people. It's amazing the I can share images or texts and my friends can see and react and comment to it. What's more cool is that I can see what other's are about to.

It is nice but I don't like it that much.

## Technically,

What I do not like with the social media platform is their collection of data. Almost everything about is being collected. Even with their privacy policy and settings, they still collect a person's personal information. This information is very confidential and I wouldn't want just anyone to know everything about me. Like for example the face detection system of the website, when you post a picture, it automatically detects who the person is. This is very scary and can be used a tracking device and expose anyone.

This is one of the reasons why I don't post any profile picture of mine. Also, I have deleted most of the pictures that I once uploaded and I use digital artworks or anime pictures as my profile photo.

## Fame

I don't like fame at all. I don't like being the center of attention of everyone. It's tiring and I just want to simply do what I want to. I know that being famous or popular gets me vulnerable to such scammers, frauds and identity theft hackers.

I don't like sharing about my personal life and going public about it. Like who cares even about me. Many use facebook only to get famous and gain attentions and just receive like and like so.

## How do I use it?

I use only my facebook account to get to know what my friends are up to because they like sharing about themselves. Also, there are many funny memes that are shared by my friends on the platform. It is where I get to relieve some of my stress and laugh at things.

So be it, I just don't like posting because of it's crazy system. I would rather prefer Twitter because they do not have this face detection thingy, I am not sure though. I prefer how simplistic it is than Facebook.
