<Content content={"Writing a content is very hard for me but sometimes, I kind of have the ability, something like that which could be of useful in here and maybe there will be times where I might not be able to write. It all depends on the time and my mood if I want to add something in here. "} />

<Content content={"Just like today, you can see that what I am saying is just repeated from all of the above. Hahhahahahha. This is just a proof that I am also lazy and might get busy to some school activities."} />
