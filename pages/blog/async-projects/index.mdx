## Creating Multiple Projects

I have created many projects that I didn't continue / finalize and finish. It is because I got bored from it, or I don't have confidence and I became bored on doing the project.

The programmer's meme about doing projects is right though. The start is very exciting but as soon as you go on, it becomes boring.

## Continous Work

Even though, even if I have many unfinished projects, I can still continue them on my free time or if my gut wants me to. With it, I can give myself time to think on what to improve with it and it's future.

This is why I kind of prefer working on many things at the same time since I really can't focus myself on doing just one thing. I like doing random stuffs and just continue working on them as time passes.

## Hehe

Welp, this is me, me myself, I do not even understand myself, .. zzzzzzzz
